  abstract = {Climate change is reshaping global biodiversity as species respond to changing temperatures. However, the net effects of climate-driven species redistribution on local assemblage diversity remain unknown. Here, we relate trends in species richness and abundance from 21,500\,terrestrial and marine assemblage time series across temperate regions (23.5\textendash 60.0\textdegree{} latitude) to changes in air or sea surface temperature. We find a strong coupling between biodiversity and temperature changes in the marine realm, where species richness mostly increases with warming. However, biodiversity responses are conditional on the baseline climate, such that in initially warmer locations richness increase is more pronounced while abundance declines with warming. In contrast, we do not detect systematic temperature-related richness or abundance trends on land, despite a greater magnitude of warming. As the world is committed to further warming, substantial challenges remain in maintaining local biodiversity amongst the non-uniform inflow and outflow of `climate migrants'. Temperature-driven community restructuring is especially evident in the ocean, whereas climatic debt may be accumulating on land.},

We detected low model adequacy overall, but with a marked tendency of improvement over time in model building and, to a lesser degree, in biological data and model evaluation.

  abstract = {Motivation The availability of user-friendly, high-resolution global environmental datasets is crucial for bioclimatic modelling. For terrestrial environments, WorldClim has served this purpose since 2005, but equivalent marine data only became available in 2012, with pioneer initiatives like Bio-ORACLE providing data layers for several ecologically relevant variables. Currently, the available marine data packages have not yet been updated to the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predictions nor to present times, and are mostly restricted to the top surface layer of the oceans, precluding the modelling of a large fraction of the benthic diversity that inhabits deeper habitats. To address this gap, we present a significant update of Bio-ORACLE for new future climate scenarios, present-day conditions and benthic layers (near sea bottom). The reliability of data layers was assessed using a cross-validation framework against in situ quality-controlled data. This test showed a generally good agreement between our data layers and the global climatic patterns. We also provide a package of functions in the R software environment (sdmpredictors) to facilitate listing, extraction and management of data layers and allow easy integration with the available pipelines for bioclimatic modelling. Main types of variable contained Surface and benthic layers for water temperature, salinity, nutrients, chlorophyll, sea ice, current velocity, phytoplankton, primary productivity, iron and light at bottom.

This framework is available for non-modeller ecologists interested in investigating future species ranges with a user-friendly script. We investigated the robustness of the framework by applying it to marine species of the Eastern English Channel.

  abstract = {Policy makers require high-level summaries of biodiversity change. However, deriving such summaries from raw biodiversity data is a complex process involving several intermediary stages. In this paper, we describe an operational workflow for generating annual estimates of species occupancy at national scales from raw species occurrence data, which can be used to construct a range of policy-relevant biodiversity indicators. We describe the workflow in detail: from data acquisition, data assessment and data manipulation, through modelling, model evaluation, application and dissemination. At each stage, we draw on our experience developing and applying the workflow for almost a decade to outline the challenges that analysts might face. These challenges span many areas of ecology, taxonomy, data science, computing and statistics. In our case, the principal output of the workflow is annual estimates of occupancy, with measures of uncertainty, for over 5000 species in each of several defined `regions' (e.g. countries, protected areas, etc.) of the UK from 1970 to 2019. This data product corresponds closely to the notion of a species distribution Essential Biodiversity Variable (EBV). Throughout the paper, we highlight methodologies that might not be applicable outside of the UK and suggest alternatives. We also highlight areas where the workflow can be improved; in particular, methods are needed to mitigate and communicate the risk of bias arising from the lack of representativeness that is typical of biodiversity data. Finally, we revisit the `ideal' and `minimal' criteria for species distribution EBVs laid out in previous contributions and pose some outstanding questions that should be addressed as a matter of priority. Going forward, we hope that this paper acts as a template for research groups around the world seeking to develop similar data products.},

Coral reef ecosystems are also threatened by environmental stressors from anthropogenic sources and shifting climates. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 14 (``Life Below Water'') addresses the need to conserve and sustainably use the ocean, seas, and marine ecosystems, including reef systems. Belize's coral reef system is the second largest in the world, providing sources of income to Belizeans through tourism and fisheries as well as coastline protection. In order to conserve their marine ecosystems, Belize has a network of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) throughout their coastal waters. Using Aqua MODIS satellite imagery from 2002 to 2022, Google Earth Engine, and RStudio, we present a workflow to calculate stress days on MPAs and a coral vulnerability index based on sea surface temperature (SST) and Kd (490), a proxy of water clarity. The Corozal Bay, Swallow Caye, Port Honduras, and South Water Caye MPAs had the highest percentages of stress days and coral vulnerability stress index score based on these two parameters among the 24 MPAs analyzed. Additionally, SST in the warmest month of the year in Belize were seen to increase across all MPAs from 2002 to 2022 (p {$<$} 0.01).

  abstract = {Introduction Efforts to collect ecological data have intensified over the last decade. This is especially true for freshwater habitats, which are among the most impacted by human activity and yet lagging behind in terms of data availability. Now, to support conservation programmes and management decisions, these data need to be analyzed and interpreted; a process that can be complex and time consuming. The South African Biodiversity Data Pipeline for Wetlands and Waterbirds (BIRDIE) aims to help fast and efficient information uptake, bridging the gap between raw ecological datasets and the information final users need. Methods BIRDIE is a full data pipeline that takes up raw data, and estimates indicators related to waterbird populations, while keeping track of their associated uncertainty. At present, we focus on the assessment of species abundance and distribution in South Africa using two citizen-science bird monitoring datasets, namely: the African Bird Atlas Project and the Coordinated Waterbird Counts. These data are analyzed with occupancy and state-space models, respectively. In addition, a suite of environmental layers help contextualize waterbird population indicators, and link these to the ecological condition of the supporting wetlands. Both data and estimated indicators are accessible to end users through an online portal and web services. Results and discussion We have designed a modular system that includes tasks, such as: data cleaning, statistical analysis, diagnostics, and computation of indicators. Envisioned users of BIRDIE include government officials, conservation managers, researchers and the general public, all of whom have been engaged throughout the project. Acknowledging that conservation programmes run at multiple spatial and temporal scales, we have developed a granular framework in which indicators are estimated at small scales, and then these are aggregated to compute similar indicators at broader scales. Thus, the online portal is designed to provide spatial and temporal visualization of the indicators using maps, time series and pre-compiled reports for species, sites and conservation programmes. In the future, we aim to expand the geographical coverage of the pipeline to other African countries, and develop more indicators specific to the ecological structure and function of wetlands.},

  abstract = {Occupancy models (Ecology, 2002; 83: 2248) were developed to infer the probability that a species under investigation occupies a site. Bayesian analysis of these models can be undertaken using statistical packages such as WinBUGS, OpenBUGS, JAGS, and more recently Stan, however, since these packages were not developed specifically to fit occupancy models, one often experiences long run times when undertaking an analysis. Bayesian spatial single-season occupancy models can also be fit using the R package stocc. The approach assumes that the detection and occupancy regression effects are modeled using probit link functions. The use of the logistic link function, however, is algebraically more tractable and allows one to easily interpret the coefficient effects of an estimated model by using odds ratios, which is not easily done for a probit link function for models that do not include spatial random effects. We develop a Gibbs sampler to obtain posterior samples from the posterior distribution of the parameters of various occupancy models (nonspatial and spatial) when logit link functions are used to model the regression effects of the detection and occupancy processes. We apply our methods to data extracted from the 2nd Southern African Bird Atlas Project to produce a species distribution map of the Cape weaver (Ploceus capensis) and helmeted guineafowl (Numida meleagris) for South Africa. We found that the Gibbs sampling algorithm developed produces posterior samples that are identical to those obtained when using JAGS and Stan and that in certain cases the posterior chains mix much faster than those obtained when using JAGS, stocc, and Stan. Our algorithms are implemented in the R package, Rcppocc. The software is freely available and stored on GitHub (https://github.com/AllanClark/Rcppocc).},

The high computing capacity of GEE can make computationally demanding analyses more accessible to researchers and practitioners, especially those with limited access to advanced computational resources. Here, we present a workflow in GEE to fit species distribution models, offering direct access to a multi-petabyte catalog of raster products to obtain estimates of habitat suitability. Innovation We implemented a workflow for species distribution modelling in GEE that includes importing species occurrence data into the GEE platform, selecting and preparing predictor variables, and performing model fitting with spatial or temporal split-block cross-validation techniques. We present three case studies that demonstrate: (i) a baseline SDM workflow that produces informative model predictions, (ii) a workflow that accounts for temporal variability in predictor variables to study changes in habitat suitability over time and (iii) a complex and computationally demanding analysis incorporating thousands of satellite images for modelling habitat suitability at high spatial resolution. Main Conclusions Our SDM workflow allows users to benefit from the high speed and performance of GEE without the need for significant computing infrastructure. This workflow may be especially beneficial to researchers in countries where computing power is limited, as SDMs frequently require the download, storage and processing of large raster datasets. We also discuss key limitations of implementing SDMs in GEE, such as user memory limits and the lack of high-level functions. We include a step-by-step guide for the general model workflow and for each of the case studies presented to facilitate its implementation.},

Core modeling brings together the new approach of ensemble of small models (ESM) and various implementations of the spatially-explicit modeling of species assemblages (SESAM) framework. Post-modeling analyses include evaluation of species predictions based on presence-only data (Boyce index) and of community predictions, phylogenetic diversity and environmentally-constrained species co-occurrences analyses.

  abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) are increasingly applied across macroscales. However, assumptions of stationarity in species-environment relationships or population trends inherent to most SDM techniques are frequently violated at broad spatial scales. Bayesian spatially-varying coefficient (SVC) models can readily account for nonstationarity, yet their use is relatively scarce, due, in part, to a gap in understanding both the data requirements needed to fit SVC SDMs, as well as the inferential benefits of applying a more complex modeling framework. Using simulations, we present guidelines and recommendations for fitting single-season and multi-season SVC SDMs. We display the inferential benefits of SVC SDMs using an empirical case study assessing spatially-varying trends of 51 forest birds in the eastern US from 2000-2019. We provide user-friendly and computationally efficient software to fit SVC SDMs in the spOccupancy R package. While all datasets are unique, we recommend a minimum sample size of \$\{\textbackslash sim\}500\$ spatial locations when fitting single-season SVC SDMs, while for multi-season SVC SDMs, \$\{\textbackslash sim\}100\$ sites is adequate for even moderate amounts of temporal replication. Within our case study, we found 88\% (45 of 51) of species had strong support for spatially-varying occurrence trends. We suggest five guidelines: (1) only fit single-season SVC SDMs with more than \$\{\textbackslash sim\}500\$ sites; (2) consider using informative priors on spatial parameters to improve spatial process estimates; (3) use data from multiple seasons if available; (4) use model selection to compare SVC SDMs with simpler alternatives; and (5) develop simulations to assess the reliability of inferences. These guidelines provide a comprehensive foundation for using SVC SDMs to evaluate the presence and impact of nonstationary environmental factors that drive species distributions at macroscales.},

  abstract = {Determining spatial distributions of species and communities are key objectives of ecology and conservation. Joint species distribution models use multi-species detection-nondetection data to estimate species and community distributions. The analysis of such data is complicated by residual correlations between species, imperfect detection, and spatial autocorrelation. While methods exist to accommodate each of these complexities, there are few examples in the literature that address and explore all three complexities simultaneously. Here we developed a spatial factor multi-species occupancy model to explicitly account for species correlations, imperfect detection, and spatial autocorrelation. The proposed model uses a spatial factor dimension reduction approach and Nearest Neighbor Gaussian Processes to ensure computational efficiency for data sets with both a large number of species (e.g., {$>$} 100) and spatial locations (e.g., 100,000). We compare the proposed model performance to five candidate models, each addressing a subset of the three complexities. We implemented the proposed and competing models in the spOccupancy software, designed to facilitate application via an accessible, well-documented, and open-source R package. Using simulations, we found ignoring the three complexities when present leads to inferior model predictive performance. Using a case study on 98 bird species across the continental US, the spatial factor multi-species occupancy model had the highest predictive performance among the candidate models. Our proposed framework, together with its implementation in spOccupancy, serves as a user-friendly tool to understand spatial variation in species distributions and biodiversity metrics while addressing common complexities in multi-species detection-nondetection data.},

Despite this, most wildlife still lives outside protected areas on private agricultural land, particularly on rangeland used for livestock grazing. Understanding which species persist and which decline in agricultural landscapes is important for global biodiversity monitoring, management and conservation. In this study, we used hierarchical multi-species occupancy modelling to estimate terrestrial vertebrate (body mass\,{$>$}\,0.5\,kg) richness in the Karoo, a semi-arid region of South Africa. We evaluated species-specific responses to different anthropogenic and environmental variables in rangeland and a nearby protected area of similar size. We grouped mammal species according to trophic guild and body size and compared their occurrence between areas. In total we detected 42 species over 4035 6-day pooled trap nights across 322 sites. Community species richness was not significantly different between the two types of land use and decreased with increasing elevation in the protected area. Human disturbance did not affect individual species occupancy in either area. Carnivores, omnivores and medium-sized species occupancy probabilities were similar between the two areas but were higher for herbivores and large species in the protected area and for insectivores and small species in rangeland. Our results reveal that drylands in the South African Karoo region, including rangeland used for small-livestock farming, support a diverse community of terrestrial vertebrates. Private landowners are thus important custodians of key components of indigenous biodiversity outside of protected areas, especially in low-lying areas.},

  abstract = {Anthropogenic change is affecting mountain regions worldwide. Managing this change and advancing biodiversity information for research requires spatially detailed information on species distributions which often is incomplete. Here, we provide a model-based approach for the integration of expert-based elevational range information with expert range maps and point occurrences to address this need. These integrated models use expert knowledge on elevational and distributional ranges as offset in a Poisson point process species distribution model (SDM). We use this approach to model the distribution of 276 hummingbird Trochilidae species at 1 km resolution and validate model performance with extensive survey data (presence\textendash absence inventories). Models including expert elevation information consistently outperformed those lacking this information. Improvements were greatest when the number of available occurrences was small, highlighting the added value from expert elevation information, especially for data-poor species. Separate validation data indicated significant increases in true skill statistics, based on higher specificity and slightly improved sensitivity. SDMs that included expert range information out-performed presence-only models based only on occurrence data in 92.5\% of cases and had higher sensitivity, lower false positive rates and smaller predicted range sizes. Generally, the integrated models removed unsuitable areas from range estimates and decreased overestimates in geographic range size (false presences) inherent in expert maps and in models lacking elevation information. By stacking SDM output we provide a first, hemispheric map of predicted hummingbird species richness modelled at 1 km resolution and identify southwest Colombia as a richness hotspot. Our study highlights the value gained from integrating multiple data types in a single framework. The presented approach improved high-resolution range predictions for single species (reducing false presences) and aggregate biodiversity patterns (e.g. reducing species richness overestimates). The method is now being implemented and expanded in Map of Life.},

Our quantitative review of the recent literature reveals a general lack of sufficient information to fully reproduce the work. Over two-thirds of the examined studies neglected to report the version or access date of the underlying data, and only half reported model parameters. To address this problem, we propose adopting a checklist to guide studies in reporting at least the minimum information necessary for ecological niche modelling reproducibility, offering a straightforward way to balance efficiency and accuracy. We encourage the ecological niche modelling community, as well as journal reviewers and editors, to utilize and further develop this framework to facilitate and improve the reproducibility of future work. The proposed checklist framework is generalizable to other areas of ecology, especially those utilizing biodiversity data, environmental data and statistical modelling, and could also be adopted by a broader array of disciplines.},

GDM can be further adapted to accommodate special types of biological and environmental data including, for example, information on phylogenetic relationships between species and information on barriers to dispersal between geographical locations. The approach can be applied to a wide range of assessment activities including visualization of spatial patterns in community composition, constrained environmental classification, distributional modelling of species or community types, survey gap analysis, conservation assessment, and climate-change impact assessment.},

  abstract = {Global warming threatens the viability of tropical coral reefs and associated marine calcifiers, including symbiont-bearing larger benthic foraminifera (LBF). The impacts of current climate change on LBF are debated because they were particularly diverse and abundant during past warm periods. Studies on the responses of selected LBF species to changing environmental conditions reveal varying results. Based on a comprehensive review of the scientific literature on LBF species occurrences, we applied species distribution modeling using Maxent to estimate present-day and future species richness patterns on a global scale for the time periods 2040\textendash 2050 and 2090\textendash 2100. For our future projections, we focus on Representative Concentration Pathway 6.0 from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which projects mean surface temperature changes of +2.2\textdegree C by the year 2100. Our results suggest that species richness in the Central Indo-Pacific is two to three times higher than in the Bahamian ecoregion, which we have identified as the present-day center of LBF diversity in the Atlantic. Our future predictions project a dramatic temperature-driven decline in low-latitude species richness and an increasing widening bimodal latitudinal pattern of species diversity. While the central Indo-Pacific, now the stronghold of LBF diversity, is expected to be most pushed outside of the currently realized niches of most species, refugia may be largely preserved in the Atlantic. LBF species will face large-scale non-analogous climatic conditions compared to currently realized climate space in the near future, as reflected in the extensive areas of extrapolation, particularly in the Indo-Pacific. Our study supports hypotheses that species richness and biogeographic patterns of LBF will fundamentally change under future climate conditions, possibly initiating a faunal turnover by the late 21st century.},

However, gaps exist regarding automated tools to delineate species' current ranges from distribution estimates and use those estimates to calculate both species- and community-level biodiversity metrics. Here, we introduce changeRangeR, an R package that facilitates workflows to reproducibly transform estimates of species' distributions into metrics relevant for conservation. For example, by combining predictions from species distribution models (SDMs) with other maps of environmental data (e.g., suitable forest cover), researchers can characterize the proportion of a species' range that is under protection, metrics used under the IUCN Criteria A and B guidelines (Area of Occupancy and Extent of Occurrence), and other more general metrics such as taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity and endemism. Further, changeRangeR facilitates temporal comparisons among biodiversity metrics to inform efforts toward complementarity and consideration of future scenarios in conservation decisions. changeRangeR also provides tools to determine the effects of modeling decisions through sensitivity tests. Transparent and repeatable workflows for calculating biodiversity change metrics from SDMs such as those provided by changeRangeR are essential to inform conservation decision-making efforts and represent key extensions for SDM methodology and associated metadata documentation.},

The zoon r package aims to overcome these problems by providing a modular framework for constructing reproducible SDM workflows. zoon modules are interoperable snippets of r code, each carrying a SDM method that zoon combines into a single analysis object. Rather than defining these modules, zoon draws modules from an open, version-controlled online repository. zoon makes it easy for SDM researchers to contribute modules to this repository, enabling others to rapidly deploy new methods in their own workflows or to compare alternative methods. Each workflow object created by zoon is a rerunnable record of the data, code and results of an entire SDM analysis. This can then be easily shared, scrutinised, reproduced and extended by the whole SDM research community. We explain how zoon works and demonstrate how it can be used to construct a completely reproducible SDM analyses, create and share a new module, and perform a methodological comparison study.},

  abstract = {The causes of biodiversity change are of great scientific interest and central to policy efforts aimed at meeting biodiversity targets. Changes in species diversity and high rates of compositional turnover have been reported worldwide. In many cases, trends in biodiversity are detected, but these trends are rarely causally attributed to possible drivers. A formal framework and guidelines for the detection and attribution of biodiversity change is needed. We propose an inferential framework to guide detection and attribution analyses, which identifies five steps\textemdash causal modelling, observation, estimation, detection and attribution\textemdash for robust attribution. This workflow provides evidence of biodiversity change in relation to hypothesized impacts of multiple potential drivers and can eliminate putative drivers from contention. The framework encourages a formal and reproducible statement of confidence about the role of drivers after robust methods for trend detection and attribution have been deployed. Confidence in trend attribution requires that data and analyses used in all steps of the framework follow best practices reducing uncertainty at each step. We illustrate these steps with examples. This framework could strengthen the bridge between biodiversity science and policy and support effective actions to halt biodiversity loss and the impacts this has on ecosystems. This article is part of the theme issue `Detecting and attributing the causes of biodiversity change: needs, gaps and solutions'.},

  abstract = {In pursuit of a more robust provenance in the field of species distribution modelling, an extensive literature search was undertaken to find the typical default values, and the range of values, for configuration settings of a large number of the most commonly used statistical algorithms available for constructing species distribution models (SDM), as implemented in the R script packages (such as Dismo and Biomod2) or other species distribution modelling programs like MaxEnt. We found that documentation of SDM algorithm configuration option settings in the SDM literature is, overall, very uncommon, and the justifications for these settings were minimal, when present. Such settings were often the R default values, or were the result of trial and error. This is potentially concerning since: (i) it detracts from the robustness of the provenance for such SDM studies; (ii) a lack of documentation of configuration option settings in a paper prevents the replication of an experiment, which contravenes one of the main tenets of the scientific method; (iii) inappropriate or uninformed configuration option settings are particularly concerning if they represent a poorly understood ecological variable or process, and if the algorithm is sensitive to such settings, this could result in erroneous and/or unrealistic SDMs. Therefore, this study sets out to comprehensively test the sensitivity of eight widely used SDM algorithms to variation in configuration options settings: MaxEnt, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Generalized Additive Model (GAM), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), Flexible Discriminant Analysis (FDA), Surface Range Envelope (SRE) and Classification tree analysis (CTA). A process of expert elicitation was used to derive a range of appropriate values with which to test the sensitivity of our algorithms. We chose to use species occurrence records for two species - Koala (Phascolartos cinereus) and Thorny Devil (Moloch horridus) - in order to investigate how algorithm sensitivity depends on the species being modelled. Results were assessed by comparing the modelled distribution of the control SDM (default settings) to the modelled distribution from each sensitivity test SDM (i.e. non-default configuration settings). This was done using the visual and statistical measures of predictive performance available in the Biodiversity and Climate Change Virtual Laboratory (BCCVL), including the area under the (receiver operating characteristic) curve. The aim of our study was to be able to draw conclusions as to how the sensitivity of SDM algorithms to their configuration option settings may detract from the reliability of SDM results, given the often unjustified and unscrutinized use of the default settings, and generally infrequent and largely perfunctory attendance to this issue in most of the published SDM literature. Our results indicate that all of the algorithms tested showed sensitivity to alternative (non-default) values for some of their configuration settings and that often this sensitivity is species-dependent. Therefore we can conclude that the choice of configuration settings in these widely used SDM algorithms can have a large impact on the resulting projected distribution. This has important ramifications for decision-making and policy outcomes wherever SDMs are used to inform species and biodiversity management plans and policy settings. This study demonstrates that assigning suitable values for these settings is a very important consideration and as such should always be published along with the model. Documenting all configuration settings is necessary to increase the scientific robustness, transparency and reproducibility of species distribution modelling studies.},

  abstract = {Motivated by the need to estimate the abundance of marine mammal populations to inform conservation assessments, especially relating to fishery bycatch, this paper provides background on abundance estimation and reviews the various methods available for pinnipeds, cetaceans and sirenians. We first give an ``entry-level'' introduction to abundance estimation, including fundamental concepts and the importance of recognizing sources of bias and obtaining a measure of precision. Each of the primary methods available to estimate abundance of marine mammals is then described, including data collection and analysis, common challenges in implementation, and the assumptions made, violation of which can lead to bias. The main method for estimating pinniped abundance is extrapolation of counts of animals (pups or all-ages) on land or ice to the whole population. Cetacean and sirenian abundance is primarily estimated from transect surveys conducted from ships, small boats or aircraft. If individuals of a species can be recognized from natural markings, mark-recapture analysis of photo-identification data can be used to estimate the number of animals using the study area. Throughout, we cite example studies that illustrate the methods described. To estimate the abundance of a marine mammal population, key issues include: defining the population to be estimated, considering candidate methods based on strengths and weaknesses in relation to a range of logistical and practical issues, being aware of the resources required to collect and analyze the data, and understanding the assumptions made. We conclude with a discussion of some practical issues, given the various challenges that arise during implementation.},

  abstract = {Ocean use has always been risky because of uncertain and dramatic ocean conditions and modern businesses continue to experience risk due to environmental extremes. A changing physical environment due to anthropogenic climate change and increased frequency of extreme events such as marine heatwaves makes past experience less valuable. This risk can be reduced by utilising seasonal forecasts that provide early warning of climate events several months ahead of time. However, to benefit from a forecast, a marine business will need to be agile to respond to changing information and response options. We define a set of seven attributes that can influence and enhance this management agility; leadership, social expectations, signal strength, system manipulation, regulatory environment, market forces, and value of the operations. The management agility of different marine businesses in fisheries, aquaculture, and tourism can influence their ability to use seasonal forecast information effectively, and potentially modify the usual negative relationship between resilience and the frequency of the stress event, thus reducing the impact of extreme events. Engagement between forecast developers and marine users can also improve responses, while at the same time, improving the agility of businesses can enhance overall resilience to extreme events and lower their risk.},

  abstract = {The accessibility of global biodiversity information has surged in the past two decades, notably through widespread funding initiatives for museum specimen digitization and emergence of large-scale public participation in community science. Effective use of these data requires the integration of disconnected datasets, but the scientific impacts of consolidated biodiversity data networks have not yet been quantified. To determine whether data integration enables novel research, we carried out a quantitative text analysis and bibliographic synthesis of {$>$}4,000 studies published from 2003 to 2019 that use data mediated by the world's largest biodiversity data network, the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). Data available through GBIF increased 12-fold since 2007, a trend matched by global data use with roughly two publications using GBIF-mediated data per day in 2019. Data-use patterns were diverse by authorship, geographic extent, taxonomic group, and dataset type. Despite facilitating global authorship, legacies of colonial science remain. Studies involving species distribution modeling were most prevalent (31\% of literature surveyed) but recently shifted in focus from theory to application. Topic prevalence was stable across the 17-y period for some research areas (e.g., macroecology), yet other topics proportionately declined (e.g., taxonomy) or increased (e.g., species interactions, disease). Although centered on biological subfields, GBIF-enabled research extends surprisingly across all major scientific disciplines. Biodiversity data mobilization through global data aggregation has enabled basic and applied research use at temporal, spatial, and taxonomic scales otherwise not possible, launching biodiversity sciences into a new era.},

  abstract = {Although people have modified the world around us throughout human history, the `Great Acceleration' has seen drivers such as land conversion, exploitation of natural populations, species introductions, pollution and human-induced climate change placing biodiversity under increasing pressure. In this paper we examine 1) how terrestrial species communities have been impacted over the last thousand years of human development and 2) how plausible futures defined by alternative socio-economic scenarios are expected to impact species communities in the future. We use the PREDICTS (Projecting Responses of Ecological Diversity In Changing Terrestrial Systems) database to model impacts of land-use change and human population on local species richness, community abundance, and biodiversity intactness using a mixed-effects modelling structure. Historical impacts are inferred through projection of model results onto maps of historical land use, provided by the land-use harmonization project, and gridded human population density (HYDE 3.1). Future impacts are explored using the Shared Socio-economic Pathway (SSP) scenarios. These scenarios detail five plausible global futures based upon socio-economic factors such as wealth, population, education, technology, and reliance on fossil fuels, and can be combined with Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios to consider climate mitigation strategies. We project model results onto the gridded outputs of six SSP/RCP scenario combinations: SSP1/RCP2.6, SSP2/RCP4.5, SSP3/RCP7.0, SSP4/RCP3.4, SSP4/RCP6.0, and SSP5/RCP8.5. Historical trend lines show that most losses in local biodiversity are relatively recent, with 75\% of all loss in both abundance-based Biodiversity Intactness Index and species richness occurring post-1800. Stark regional differences emerge in all future scenarios, with biodiversity in African regions undergoing greater losses than Oceania, North America and the European regions. Although climate change is expected to have severe detrimental impacts to biodiversity \textendash{} which are not quantified in these results \textendash{} it is important to consider how the climate change mitigation itself may also impact biodiversity. Our results suggest that strong climate change mitigation through biofuel production will detrimentally impact biodiversity: SSP4/RCP3.4 (with high biofuel mitigation) is predicted to see two times the decrease in abundance-based biodiversity intactness and three times the decrease in local species richness between 2015\textendash 2100 as is predicted for SSP4/RCP6.0 (with lower levels of mitigation). SSP4/RCP3.4 forecasts the greatest impact to average local species richness of all the SSP/RCP combinations with an average loss of 13\% of local species richness projected to have occurred by 2100. SSP3/RCP7.0 \textendash{} a scenario describing a globally segregated, and economically protectionist future with low climate change mitigation \textendash{} has the worst impacts on abundance-based biodiversity intactness with an average loss of 26\% of intactness by 2100. However, a brighter future is possible; SSP1/RCP2.6 describes a more sustainable future, where human populations are provided for without further jeopardising environmental integrity \textendash{} in this scenario we project that biodiversity will recover somewhat, with gains in biodiversity intactness and species richness in many regions of the world by 2100.},

  abstract = {Ocean ecosystems are vulnerable to climate-driven perturbations, which are increasing in frequency and can have profound effects on marine social-ecological systems. Thus, there is an urgency to develop tools that can detect the response of ecosystem components to these perturbations as early as possible. We used Bayesian Dynamic Factor Analysis (DFA) to develop a community state indicator for the California Current Ecosystem (CCE) to track the system's response to climate perturbations, and to forecast future changes in community state. Our key objectives were to (1) summarize environmental and biological variability in the southern and central regions of the CCE during a recent and unprecedented marine heatwave in the northeast Pacific Ocean (2014\textendash 2016) and compare these patterns to past variability, (2) examine whether there is evidence of a shift in the community to a new state in response to the heatwave, (3) identify relationships between community variability and climate variables; and (4) test our ability to create one-year ahead forecasts of individual species responses and the broader community response based on ocean conditions. Our analysis detected a clear community response to the marine heatwave, although it did not exceed normal variability over the past six decades (1951\textendash 2017), and we did not find evidence of a shift to a new community state. We found that nitrate flux through the base of the mixed layer exhibited the strongest relationship with species and community-level responses. Furthermore, we demonstrated skill in creating forecasts of species responses and community state based on estimates of nitrate flux. Our indicator and forecasts of community state show promise as tools for informing ecosystem-based and climate-ready fisheries management in the CCE. Our modeling framework is also widely applicable to other ecosystems where scientists and managers are faced with the challenge of managing and protecting living marine resources in a rapidly changing climate.},

  abstract = {Species distributions and abundances are undergoing rapid changes worldwide. This highlights the significance of reliable, integrated information for guiding and assessing actions and policies aimed at managing and sustaining the many functions and benefits of species. Here we synthesize the types of data and approaches that are required to achieve such an integration and conceptualize `essential biodiversity variables' (EBVs) for a unified global capture of species populations in space and time. The inherent heterogeneity and sparseness of raw biodiversity data are overcome by the use of models and remotely sensed covariates to inform predictions that are contiguous in space and time and global in extent. We define the species population EBVs as a space\textendash time\textendash species\textendash gram (cube) that simultaneously addresses the distribution or abundance of multiple species, with its resolution adjusted to represent available evidence and acceptable levels of uncertainty. This essential information enables the monitoring of single or aggregate spatial or taxonomic units at scales relevant to research and decision-making. When combined with ancillary environmental or species data, this fundamental species population information directly underpins a range of biodiversity and ecosystem function indicators. The unified concept we present links disparate data to downstream uses and informs a vision for species population monitoring in which data collection is closely integrated with models and infrastructure to support effective biodiversity assessment.},

  abstract = {Most knowledge about species and habitats is in-homogeneously distributed, with biases existing in space, time and taxonomic and functional knowledge. Yet, controversially the total amount of biodiversity data has never been greater. A key challenge is thus how to make effective use of the various sources of biodiversity data in an integrated manner. Particularly for widely used modelling approaches, such as species distribution models (SDMs), the need for integration is urgent, if spatial and temporal predictions are to be accurate enough in addressing global challenges. Here, I present a modelling framework that brings together several ideas and methodological advances for creating integrated species distribution models (iSDM). The ibis.iSDM R-package is a set of modular convenience functions that allows the integration of different data sources, such as presence-only, community survey, expert ranges or species habitat preferences, in a single model or ensemble of models. Further it supports convenient parameter transformations and tuning, data preparation helpers and allows the creation of spatial-temporal projections and scenarios. Ecological constraints such as projection limits, dispersal, connectivity or adaptability can be added in a modular fashion thus helping to prevent unrealistic estimates of species distribution changes. The ibis.iSDM R-package makes use of a series of methodological advances and is aimed to be a vehicle for creating more realistic and constrained spatial predictions. Besides providing convenience functions for a range of different statistical models as well as an increasing number of wrappers for mechanistic modules, ibis.iSDM also introduces several innovative concepts such as sequential or weighted integration, or thresholding by prediction uncertainty. The overall framework will be continued to be improved and further functionalities be added.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: The lack of comprehensive sighting data sets precludes the application of standard habitat suitability modeling approaches to predict distributions of the majority of marine mammal species on very large scales. As an alternative, we developed an ecological niche model to map global distributions of 115 cetacean and pinniped species living in the marine environment using more readily available expert knowledge about habitat usage. We started by assigning each species to broad-scale niche categories with respect to depth, sea-surface temperature, and ice edge association based on synopses of published information. Within a global information system framework and a global grid of 0.5\textdegree{} latitude/longitude cell dimensions, we then generated an index of the relative environmental suitability (RES) of each cell for a given species by relating known habitat usage to local environmental conditions. RES predictions closely matched published maximum ranges for most species, thus representing useful, more objective alternatives to existing sketched distributional outlines. In addition, raster-based predictions provided detailed information about heterogeneous patterns of potentially suitable habitat for species throughout their range. We tested RES model outputs for 11 species (northern fur seal, harbor porpoise, sperm whale, killer whale, hourglass dolphin, fin whale, humpback whale, blue whale, Antarctic minke, and dwarf minke whales) from a broad taxonomic and geographic range, using data from dedicated surveys. Observed encounter rates and species-specific predicted environmental suitability were significantly and positively correlated for all but 1 species. In comparison, encounter rates were correlated with {$<$}1\% of 1000 simulated random data sets for all but 2 species. Mapping of large-scale marine mammal distributions using this environmental envelope model is helpful for evaluating current assumptions and knowledge about species' occurrences, especially for data-poor species. Moreover, RES modeling can help to focus research efforts on smaller geographic scales and usefully supplement other, statistical, habitat suitability models.},

ENMeval was the first R package to make such evaluations (often termed model tuning) widely accessible for the Maxent algorithm. It also provided multiple methods for partitioning occurrence data and reported various performance metrics. Requests by users, recent developments in the field, and needs for software compatibility led to a major redesign and expansion. We additionally conducted a literature review to investigate trends in ENMeval use (2015\textendash 2019). ENMeval 2.0 has a new object-oriented structure for adding other algorithms, enables customizing algorithmic settings and performance metrics, generates extensive metadata, implements a null-model approach to quantify significance and effect sizes, and includes features to increase the breadth of analyses and visualizations. In our literature review, we found insufficient reporting of model performance and parameterization, heavy reliance on model selection with AICc and low utilization of spatial cross-validation; we explain how ENMeval 2.0 can help address these issues. This redesigned and expanded version can promote progress in the field and improve the information available for decision-making. \hspace{0pt}},

Since its release, feedback from users and partners helped identify key areas for advancement, leading to the development of wallace 2. Following the vision of growth by community expansion, the core development team engaged with collaborators and undertook a major restructuring of the application to enable: simplified addition of custom modules to expand methodological options, analyses for multiple species in the same session, improved metadata features, new database connections, and saving/loading sessions. wallace 2 features nine new modules and added functionalities that facilitate data acquisition from climate-simulation, botanical and paleontological databases; custom data inputs; model metadata tracking; and citations for R packages used (to promote documentation and give credit to developers). Three of these modules compose a new component for environmental space analyses (e.g., niche overlap). This expansion was paired with outreach to the biogeography and biodiversity communities, including international presentations and workshops that take advantage of the software's extensive guidance text. Additionally, the advances extend accessibility with a cloud-computing implementation and include a suite of comprehensive unit tests. The features in wallace 2 greatly improve its expandability, breadth of analyses, and reproducibility options, including the use of emerging metadata standards. The new architecture serves as an example for other modular software, especially those developed using the rapidly proliferating R package shiny, by showcasing straightforward module ingestion and unit testing. Importantly, wallace 2 sets the stage for future expansions, including those enabling biodiversity estimation and threat assessments for conservation.},

Ambitious targets have been proposed, such as reversing the declining trends in biodiversity3; however, just feeding the growing human population will make this a challenge4. Here we use an ensemble of land-use and biodiversity models to assess whether\textemdash and how\textemdash humanity can reverse the declines in terrestrial biodiversity caused by habitat conversion, which is a major threat to biodiversity5. We show that immediate efforts, consistent with the broader sustainability agenda but of unprecedented ambition and coordination, could enable the provision of food for the growing human population while reversing the global terrestrial biodiversity trends caused by habitat conversion. If we decide to increase the extent of land under conservation management, restore degraded land and generalize landscape-level conservation planning, biodiversity trends from habitat conversion could become positive by~the mid-twenty-first century on average across models (confidence interval, 2042\textendash 2061), but this was not the case for all models. Food prices could increase and, on average across models, almost half (confidence interval, 34\textendash 50\%) of the future biodiversity losses could not be avoided. However, additionally tackling the drivers of land-use change could avoid conflict with affordable food provision and reduces the environmental effects of the food-provision system. Through further sustainable intensification and trade, reduced food waste and more plant-based human diets, more than two thirds of future biodiversity losses are avoided and the biodiversity trends from habitat conversion are reversed by 2050 for almost all of the models. Although limiting further loss will remain challenging in several biodiversity-rich regions, and other threats\textemdash such as climate change\textemdash must be addressed to truly reverse the declines in biodiversity, our results show that ambitious conservation efforts and food system transformation are central to an effective post-2020 biodiversity strategy.},

  abstract = {Ecological niche models are powerful tools in ecology. Factors operating at different spatial scales are known to jointly influence species distributions, but their integration in meaningful and reliable niche models is still methodologically complex and requires further research and validation. Here, we compare six different hierarchical niche models (HNMs): two ensemble, two Bayesian, and two penalized logistic regression approaches. The six HNMs were applied to produce high-resolution (25\,m) predictions for five tree species in a Biosphere Reserve in Central Spain, combining information from two spatial scales. At the regional scale (mainland Spain) climatic variables were used as predictors, and presence/absence data were derived from the Spanish Forest Inventory (76,347 plots). At the landscape scale (Biosphere Reserve) environmental variables were used as predictors while presence/absence data were derived from a local vegetation sampling (346 plots). We compared and evaluated the six HNMs using the AUC, MaxKappa, and MaxTSS statistics and the Pearson's correlation coefficient. We obtained reliable high-resolution HNMs at the landscape scale (AUC values were greater than 0.8), although with variable performance and scope of application. Ensemble approaches delivered reliable models particularly when the sample size was not a limiting modelling factor. However, Bayesian modelling allowed considering a spatially correlated random effect that outperformed the results of all other approaches for species with a low sample size, possibly derived from a strong spatial structure in their distribution. HNMs succeeded in generating high-resolution predictions and manage to identify a significantly greater part of the climatic niche of the species than non-hierarchical models. This allows more accurate projections both in space and time, which is essential in climate change and invasive species modelling projections. The usefulness of these models for decision support in local conservation programs is therefore highlighted. Our methodological comparison is valuable to inform modellers and decision makers of the performance and implications of these approaches regarding the support they can provide for the implementation of conservation management measures at the landscape scale.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the use of ecological niche models (ENMs) and species distribution models (SDMs) to explore the patterns and processes behind observed distribution of species has experienced an explosive growth. Although the use of these methods has been less common and more recent in marine ecosystems than in a terrestrial context, they have shown significant increases in use and applications. Herein, we provide a systematic review of 328 articles on marine ENMs and SDMs published between 1990 and 2016, aiming to identify their main applications and the diversity of methodological frameworks in which they are developed, including spatial scale, geographic realm, taxonomic groups assessed, algorithms implemented, and data sources. Of the 328 studies, 48 \% were at local scales, with a hotspot of research effort in the North Atlantic Ocean. Most studies were based on correlative approaches and were used to answer ecological or biogeographic questions about mechanisms underlying geographic ranges (64 \%). A few attempted to evaluate impacts of climate change (19 \%) or to develop strategies for conservation (11 \%). Several correlative techniques have been used, but most common was the machine-learning approach Maxent (46 \%) and statistical approaches such as generalized additive models GAMs (22 \%) and generalized linear models, GLMs (14 \%). The groups most studied were fish (23 \%), molluscs (16 \%), and marine mammals (14 \%), the first two with commercial importance and the last important for conservation. We noted a lack of clarity regarding the definitions of ENMs versus SDMs, and a rather consistent failure to differentiate between them. This review exposed a need to know, reduce, and report error and uncertainty associated with species' occurrence records and environmental data. In addition, particular to marine realms, a third dimension should be incorporated into the modelling process, referring to the vertical position of the species, which will improve the precision and utility of these models. So too is of paramount importance the consideration of temporal and spatial resolution of environmental layers to adequately represent the dynamic nature of marine ecosystems, especially in the case of highly mobile species.},

  abstract = {Aim Knowledge of species geographical distributions is critical for many ecological and evolutionary questions and underpins effective conservation decision-making, yet it is usually limited in spatial resolution or reliability. Over large spatial extents, range predictions are typically derived from expert knowledge or, increasingly, species distribution models based on individual occurrence records. Expert maps are useful at coarse resolution, where they are suitable for delineating unoccupied regions. In contrast, point records typically provide finer-scale occurrence information that can be characterized for its environmental association, but usually suffers from observer biases and does not representatively or fully address the geographical or environmental range occupied by a species. Innovation We develop a new modelling methodology to combine the complementary informative attributes of both data types to improve fine-scale, large-extent predictions. We use expert delineations to constrain predictions of a species distribution model parameterized with incidental point occurrence records. We introduce a maximum entropy approach for combining the two data types and generalize it to Poisson point process models. We illustrate critical decision making during model construction using two detailed case studies and illustrate features more generally with applications to species with vastly different range and data attributes. Our methods are illustrated in the Supporting Information and with a new R package, bossMaps, that integrates with existing generalized linear modelling and Maxent software. Main conclusions Our modelling strategy flexibly accommodates expert maps with different levels of bias and precision. The approach can also be useful with other coarse sources of spatially explicit information, including habitat associations, elevational bands or vegetation types. The flexible nature of this methodological innovation can support improved characterization of species distributions for a variety of applications and is being implemented as a standard element underpinning integrative species distribution predictions in the Map of Life (https://mol.org/).},

  abstract = {Estimates of species' ranges can inform many aspects of biodiversity research and conservation-management decisions. Many practical applications need high-precision range estimates that are sufficiently reliable to use as input data in downstream applications. One solution has involved expert-generated maps that reflect on-the-ground field information and implicitly capture various processes that may limit a species' geographic distribution. However, expert maps are often subjective and rarely reproducible. In contrast, species distribution models (SDMs) typically have finer resolution and are reproducible because of explicit links to data. Yet, SDMs can have higher uncertainty when data are sparse, which is an issue for most species. Also, SDMs often capture only a subset of the factors that determine species distributions (e.g., climate) and hence can require significant post-processing to better estimate species' current realized distributions. Here, we demonstrate how expert knowledge, diverse data types, and SDMs can be used together in a transparent and reproducible modeling workflow. Specifically, we show how expert knowledge regarding species' habitat use, elevation, biotic interactions, and environmental tolerances can be used to make and refine range estimates using SDMs and various data sources, including high-resolution remotely sensed products. This range-refinement approach is primed to use various data sources, including many with continuously improving spatial or temporal resolution. To facilitate such analyses, we compile a comprehensive suite of tools in a new R package, maskRangeR, and provide worked examples. These tools can facilitate a wide variety of basic and applied research that requires high-resolution maps of species' current ranges, including quantifications of biodiversity and its change over time.},

Niche and distribution modelling methods require a litany of design choices; differences among subdisciplines have created communication barriers that increase isolation of scientific advances. As a result, understanding and reproducing the work of others is difficult, if not impossible. It is often challenging to evaluate whether a model has been built appropriately for its intended application or subsequent reuse. Here, we propose a standardized model metadata framework that enables researchers to understand and evaluate modelling decisions while making models fully citable and reproducible. Such reproducibility is critical for both scientific and policy reports, while international standardization enables better comparison between different scenarios and research groups. Innovation Range modelling metadata (RMMS) address three challenges: they (a) are designed for convenience to encourage use, (b) accommodate a wide variety of applications, and (c) are extensible to allow the research community to steer them as needed. RMMS are based on a metadata dictionary that specifies a hierarchical structure to catalogue different aspects of the range modelling process. The dictionary balances a constrained, minimalist vocabulary to improve standardization with flexibility for users to modify and extend. To facilitate use, we have developed an R package, rangeModelMetaData, to build templates, automatically fill values from common modelling objects, check for inconsistencies with standards, and suggest values. Main conclusions Range Modelling Metadata tools foster cross-disciplinary advances in biogeography, conservation and allied disciplines by improving evaluation, model sharing, model searching, comparisons and reproducibility among studies. Our initially proposed standards here are designed to be modified and extended to evolve with research trends and needs.},

This has spurred the development of data integration methods that simultaneously harness information from multiple datasets while dealing with the specific strengths and weaknesses of each dataset. We outline the general principles that have guided data integration methods and review recent developments in the field. We then outline key areas that allow for a more general framework for integrating data and provide suggestions for improving sampling design and validation for integrated models. Key to recent advances has been using point-process thinking to combine estimators developed for different data types. Extending this framework to new data types will further improve our inferences, as well as relaxing assumptions about how parameters are jointly estimated. These along with the better use of information regarding sampling effort and spatial autocorrelation will further improve our inferences. Recent developments form a strong foundation for implementation of data integration models. Wider adoption can improve our inferences about species distributions and the dynamic processes that lead to distributional shifts.},

However, most spatial models of species richness do not explicitly consider inter-specific interactions. Here, we test whether incorporating biotic interactions into high-resolution models alters predictions of species richness as hypothesised. We included key biotic variables (cover of three dominant arctic-alpine plant species) into two methodologically divergent species richness modelling frameworks \textendash{} stacked species distribution models (SSDM) and macroecological models (MEM) \textendash{} for three ecologically and evolutionary distinct taxonomic groups (vascular plants, bryophytes and lichens). Predictions from models including biotic interactions were compared to the predictions of models based on climatic and abiotic data only. Including plant\textendash plant interactions consistently and significantly lowered bias in species richness predictions and increased predictive power for independent evaluation data when compared to the conventional climatic and abiotic data based models. Improvements in predictions were constant irrespective of the modelling framework or taxonomic group used. The global biodiversity crisis necessitates accurate predictions of how changes in biotic and abiotic conditions will potentially affect species richness patterns. Here, we demonstrate that models of the spatial distribution of species richness can be improved by incorporating biotic interactions, and thus that these key predictor factors must be accounted for in biodiversity forecasts.},

The number of studies applying GDM is expanding, with increasing recognition of its value in improving our understanding of the drivers of biodiversity patterns and in implementing a wide variety of spatial assessments relevant to biodiversity conservation. However, apart from the original presentation of the GDM technique, there has been little guidance available to users on applying GDM to different situations or on the key modelling decisions required. Innovation We present an accessible working guide to GDM. We describe the context for the development of GDM, present a simple statistical explanation of how model fitting works, and step through key considerations involved in data preparation, model fitting, refinement and assessment. We then describe how several novel spatial biodiversity analyses can be implemented using GDM, with code to support broader implementation. We conclude by providing an overview of the range of GDM-based analyses that have been undertaken to date and identify priority areas for future research and development. Main conclusions Our vision is that this working guide will facilitate greater and more rigorous use of GDM as a powerful tool for undertaking biodiversity analyses and assessments.},

Two major efforts to provide marine species distributions at a global scale are the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which provides expert-generated range maps that outline the complete extent of a species' distribution; and AquaMaps, which provides model-generated species distribution maps that predict areas occupied by the species. Together these databases represent 24,586 species (93.1\% within AquaMaps, 16.4\% within IUCN), with only 2,330 shared species. Differences in intent and methodology can result in very different predictions of species distributions, which bear important implications for scientists and decision makers who rely upon these datasets when conducting research or informing conservation policy and management actions. Comparing distributions for the small subset of species with maps in both datasets, we found that AquaMaps and IUCN range maps show strong agreement for many well-studied species, but our analysis highlights several key examples in which introduced errors drive differences in predicted species ranges. In particular, we find that IUCN maps greatly overpredict coral presence into unsuitably deep waters, and we show that some AquaMaps computer-generated default maps (only 5.7\% of which have been reviewed by experts) can produce odd discontinuities at the extremes of a species' predicted range. We illustrate the scientific and management implications of these tradeoffs by repeating a global analysis of gaps in coverage of marine protected areas, and find significantly different results depending on how the two datasets are used. By highlighting tradeoffs between the two datasets, we hope to encourage increased collaboration between taxa experts and large scale species distribution modeling efforts to further improve these foundational datasets, helping to better inform science and policy recommendations around understanding, managing, and protecting marine biodiversity.},

  abstract = {Biodiversity studies rely heavily on estimates of species' distributions often obtained through ecological niche modelling. Numerous software packages exist that allow users to model ecological niches using machine learning and statistical methods. However, no existing package with a graphical user interface allows users to perform model calibration and selection based on convex forms such as ellipsoids, which may match fundamental ecological niche shapes better, incorporating tools for exploring, modelling, and evaluating niches and distributions that are intuitive for both novice and proficient users. Here we describe an r package, NicheToolBox (ntbox), that allows users to conduct all processing steps involved in ecological niche modelling: downloading and curating occurrence data, obtaining and transforming environmental data layers, selecting environmental variables, exploring relationships between geographic and environmental spaces, calibrating and selecting ellipsoid models, evaluating models using binomial and partial ROC tests, assessing extrapolation risk, and performing geographic information system operations via a graphical user interface. A summary of the entire workflow is produced for use as a stand-alone algorithm or as part of research reports. The method is explained in detail and tested via modelling the threatened feline species Leopardus wiedii. Georeferenced occurrence data for this species are queried to display both point occurrences and the IUCN extent of occurrence polygon (IUCN, 2007). This information is used to illustrate tools available for accessing, processing and exploring biodiversity data (e.g. number of occurrences and chronology of collecting) and transforming environmental data (e.g. a summary PCA for 19 bioclimatic layers). Visualizations of three-dimensional ecological niches modelled as minimum volume ellipsoids are developed with ancillary statistics. This niche model is then projected to geographic space, to represent a corresponding potential suitability map. Using ntbox allows a fast and straightforward means by which to retrieve and manipulate occurrence and environmental data, which can then be implemented in model calibration, projection and evaluation for assessing distributions of species in geographic space and their corresponding environmental combinations.},

We provide examples of a basic occurrence search and citation workflow as well as an advanced workflow using features for custom optimized searches, visualization, and summary procedures. occCite improves upon existing R packages by uniting data from powerful API-based query packages (rgbif and BIEN) into a unified object-based framework, while maintaining metadata vital to best-practice recommendations for documenting biodiversity analysis workflows. occCite aims to efficiently close the gap in the citation cycle between primary data providers and final research products, allowing researchers to meet dataset documentation standards without sacrificing time and resources to the demands of providing increasing levels of detail on their datasets.},

The new release (ver. 3.4.0) will be hosted online by the American Museum of Natural History, along with future versions. It contains small functional changes, most notably use of a complementary log-log (cloglog) transform to produce an estimate of occurrence probability. The cloglog transform derives from the recently-published interpretation of Maxent as an inhomogeneous Poisson process (IPP), giving it a stronger theoretical justification than the logistic transform which it replaces by default. In addition, the new R package, maxnet, fits Maxent models using the glmnet package for regularized generalized linear models. We discuss the implications of the IPP formulation in terms of model inputs and outputs, treating occurrence records as points rather than grid cells and interpreting the exponential Maxent model (raw output) as as an estimate of relative abundance. With these two open-source developments, we invite others to freely use and contribute to the software.},

  abstract = {Species distribution models have grown in complexity by incorporating fine-scale variables, including data on microclimate, physiology and species interactions. Recent studies have acknowledged the importance of the spatial scale by including higher resolution maps and more complex climatic variables. However, models rarely consider the consequences of including data related to time. Indeed, species phenology \textendash{} and potential shifts in phenology due, for example, to climate change \textendash{} is potentially one of the most neglected aspects of ecological modelling. We present a literature review of relevant phenological aspects at different temporal scales and across several taxa. Such elements should be considered to define better the environmental niche and project present, future and past distribution models. We considered the available studies on plants, insects, reptiles, birds and mammals to evaluate how they dealt with the phenology of the investigated species, as well as the phenology of other resources and interacting species, to infer present, past and future projections. Here we focus on four main phenological aspects that, if not considered, may easily bias any projection, namely: 1) phenology can be accompanied by a shift in distribution within the year (e.g. migratory species); 2) activity may be restricted to a portion of the year (e.g. most ectotherms from temperate climates); 3) survival and reproduction success may depend on the synchrony with other species phenology (e.g. plants\textendash pollinators interactions); 4) changes in climatic conditions can lead to shifts in phenology (e.g. anticipated or delayed blooms or changes in migration timing). In this review, we show how neglecting such factors may quickly lead to project a biased distribution. Finally, we provide a guide on evaluating whether the case study may be affected by such factors and what actions may improve the models.},

In the marine environment there is a significant challenge to the production of range maps due to large biases in the amount and location of occurrence data for most species. AquaMaps is compared with traditional presence-only species distribution modelling methods to determine the quality of outputs under equivalently automated conditions. The effect of the inclusion of expert knowledge to AquaMaps is also investigated. Model outputs were tested internally, through data partitioning, and externally against independent survey data to determine the ability of models to predict presence versus absence. Models were also tested externally by assessing correlation with independent survey estimates of relative species abundance. AquaMaps outputs compare well to the existing methods tested, and inclusion of expert knowledge results in a general improvement in model outputs. The transparency, speed and adaptability of the AquaMaps system, as well as the existing online framework which allows expert review to compensate for sampling biases and thus improve model predictions are proposed as additional benefits for public and research use alike.},

Since its arrival, the destructive grazing of the urchin has led to widespread formation of sea urchin `barrens'. The loss of habitat, biodiversity and productivity for important commercial reef species in conjunction with the development of an urchin fishery has led to conflicting objectives among some stakeholders that pose complex challenges for regional management. Stakeholders representatives and managers were engaged via a participatory workshop and subsequent one-on-one surveys to trial a structured decision making process to identify effective ecosystem-based management strategies. We directly and indirectly elicited each preferences for nine alternative management strategies by presenting them with the 10-year consequences of each strategy estimated from an ecosystem model of Tasmanian reef communities. These preferences were included in cost-effectiveness scores that were averaged (across stakeholders) to enable strategy ranking from most to least cost-effective. Rankings revealed strategies that included sea urchin removal or translocation of predatory lobsters were the most cost-effective. However, assessment of stakeholders' individual cost-effectiveness scores showed some disparity among preferences in high ranking strategies. Additionally, inconsistencies in strategy preferences using alternative (direct or indirect) ranking scores reveal conflicting objectives as the most plausible explanation. Our study illustrates how structured decision making can effectively facilitate ecosystem-based management by engaging stakeholders step-by-step towards management strategy implementation and promoting collective learning.},

  abstract = {Ecological niche models (ENM) use the environmental variables associated with the currently known distribution of a species to model its ecological niche and project it into the geographic space. Widely used and misused, ENM has become a common tool for ecologists and decision-makers. Many ENM platforms have been developed over the years, first as standalone programs, later as packages within script-based programming languages and environments. The democratization of these programming tools and the advent of Open Science brought a growing concern regarding the reproducibility, transparency, robustness, portability, and interoperability in ENM workflows. ENM workflows have some core components that are replicated between projects. However, they have a large internal variation due to the variety of research questions and applications. Any ecological niche modeling platform should take into account this trade-off between stability and reproducibility on one hand, and flexibility and decision-making on the other. Here, we present modleR, a four-step workflow that wraps some of the common phases executed during an ecological niche model procedure. We have divided the process into (1) data setup, (2) model fitting and projection, (3) partition joining and (4) ensemble modeling (consensus between algorithms). modleR is highly adaptable and replicable depending on the user's needs and is open to deeper internal parametrization. It can be used as a testing platform due to its consistent folder structure and its capacity to control some sources of variation while changing others. It can be run in interactive local sessions and in high-performance or high-throughput computational (HPC/HTC) platforms and parallelized by species or algorithms. It can also communicate with other tools in the field, allowing the user to enter and exit the workflow at any phase, and execute complementary routines outside the package. Finally, it records metadata and session information at each step, ensuring reproducibility beyond the use of script-based applications.},

  abstract = {Aim Forecasting changes in species distribution under future scenarios is one of the most prolific areas of application for species distribution models (SDMs). However, no consensus yet exists on the reliability of such models for drawing conclusions on species' distribution response to changing climate. In this study, we provide an overview of common modelling practices in the field and assess the reliability of model predictions using a virtual species approach. Location Global. Methods We first review papers published between 2015 and 2019. Then, we use a virtual species approach and three commonly applied SDM algorithms (GLM, MaxEnt and random forest) to assess the estimated and actual predictive performance of models parameterized with different modelling settings and violations of modelling assumptions. Results Most SDM papers relied on single models (65\%) and small samples (N {$<$} 50, 62\%), used presence-only data (85\%), binarized models' output (74\%) and used a split-sample validation (94\%). Our simulation reveals that the split-sample validation tends to be over-optimistic compared to the real performance, whereas spatial block validation provides a more honest estimate, except when datasets are environmentally biased. The binarization of predicted probabilities of presence reduces models' predictive ability considerably. Sample size is one of the main predictors of the real model accuracy, but has little influence on estimated accuracy. Finally, the inclusion of ecologically irrelevant predictors and the violation of modelling assumptions increases estimated accuracy but decreases real accuracy of model projections, leading to biased estimates of range contraction and expansion. Main conclusions Our ability to predict future species distribution is low on average, particularly when models' predictions are binarized. A robust validation by spatially independent samples is required, but does not rule out inflation of model accuracy by assumption violation. Our findings call for caution in the application and interpretation of SDM projections under different climates.},

Here, we summarise examples from several sectors and a range of locations. We describe the need, approach, forecast performance, delivery system, and end user uptake. This examination shows that near-term ecological forecasts are needed by end users, decisions are being made based on forecasts, and there is an urgent need to develop operational information systems to support sustainable ocean management. An operational information system is critical for connecting to decision makers and providing an enduring approach to forecasting and proactive decision making. These operational systems require significant investment and ongoing maintenance but are key to delivering ecological forecasts for societal benefits. Iterative forecasting practices could provide continuous improvement by incorporating evaluation and feedback to overcome the limitations of the imperfect model and incomplete observations to achieve better forecast outcomes and accuracy.},

  abstract = {Time is running out to limit further devastating losses of biodiversity and nature's contributions to humans. Addressing this crisis requires accurate predictions about which species and ecosystems are most at risk to ensure efficient use of limited conservation and management resources. We review existing biodiversity projection models and discover problematic gaps. Current models usually cannot easily be reconfigured for other species or systems, omit key biological processes, and cannot accommodate feedbacks with Earth system dynamics. To fill these gaps, we envision an adaptable, accessible, and universal biodiversity modeling platform that can project essential biodiversity variables, explore the implications of divergent socioeconomic scenarios, and compare conservation and management strategies. We design a roadmap for implementing this vision and demonstrate that building this biodiversity forecasting platform is possible and practical.},

  abstract = {Opportunistically collected species occurrence data are often used for species distribution models (SDMs) when high-quality data collected through standardized recording protocols are unavailable. While opportunistic data are abundant, uncertainty is usually high, e.g. due to observer effects or a lack of metadata. To increase data quality and improve model performance, we filtered species records based on record attributes that provide information on the observation process or post-entry data validation. Data filtering does not only increase the quality of species records, it simultaneously reduces sample size, a trade-off that remains relatively unexplored. By controlling for sample size in a dataset of 255 species, we were able to explore the combined impact of data quality and sample size on model performance. We applied three data quality filters based on observers' activity, the validation status of a record in the database and the detail of a submitted record, and analyzed changes in AUC, Sensitivity and Specificity using Maxent with and without filtering. The impact of stringent filtering on model performance depended on (1) the quality of the filtered data: records validated as correct and more detailed records lead to higher model performance, (2) the proportional reduction in sample size caused by filtering and the remaining absolute sample size: filters causing small reductions that lead to sample sizes of more than 100 presences generally benefitted model performance and (3) the taxonomic group: plant and dragonfly models benefitted more from data quality filtering compared to bird and butterfly models. Our results also indicate that recommendations for quality filtering depend on the goal of the study, e.g. increasing Sensitivity and/or Specificity. Further research must identify what drives species' sensitivity to data quality. Nonetheless, our study confirms that large quantities of volunteer generated and opportunistically collected data can make a valuable contribution to ecological research and species conservation.},

  abstract = {Balancing model complexity is a key challenge of modern computational ecology, particularly so since the spread of machine learning algorithms. Species distribution models are often implemented using a wide variety of machine learning algorithms that can be fine-tuned to achieve the best model prediction while avoiding overfitting. We have released SDMtune, a new R package that aims to facilitate training, tuning, and evaluation of species distribution models in a unified framework. The main innovations of this package are its functions to perform data-driven variable selection, and a novel genetic algorithm to tune model hyperparameters. Real-time and interactive charts are displayed during the execution of several functions to help users understand the effect of removing a variable or varying model hyperparameters on model performance. SDMtune supports three different metrics to evaluate model performance: the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, the true skill statistic, and Akaike's information criterion corrected for small sample sizes. It implements four statistical methods: artificial neural networks, boosted regression trees, maximum entropy modeling, and random forest. Moreover, it includes functions to display the outputs and create a final report. SDMtune therefore represents a new, unified and user-friendly framework for the still-growing field of species distribution modeling.},

  abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) are widely used in basic and applied ecology, making it important to understand sources and magnitudes of uncertainty in SDM performance and predictions. We analyzed SDM performance and partitioned variance among prediction maps for 15 rare vertebrate species in the southeastern USA using all possible combinations of seven potential sources of uncertainty in SDMs: algorithms, climate datasets, model domain, species presences, variable collinearity, CO2 emissions scenarios, and general circulation models. The choice of modeling algorithm was the greatest source of uncertainty in SDM performance and prediction maps, with some additional variation in performance associated with the comprehensiveness of the species presences used for modeling. Other sources of uncertainty that have received attention in the SDM literature such as variable collinearity and model domain contributed little to differences in SDM performance or predictions in this study. Predictions from different algorithms tended to be more variable at northern range margins for species with more northern distributions, which may complicate conservation planning at the leading edge of species' geographic ranges. The clear message emerging from this work is that researchers should use multiple algorithms for modeling rather than relying on predictions from a single algorithm, invest resources in compiling a comprehensive set of species presences, and explicitly evaluate uncertainty in SDM predictions at leading range margins.},

  abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) constitute the most common class of models across ecology, evolution and conservation. The advent of ready-to-use software packages and increasing availability of digital geoinformation have considerably assisted the application of SDMs in the past decade, greatly enabling their broader use for informing conservation and management, and for quantifying impacts from global change. However, models must be fit for purpose, with all important aspects of their development and applications properly considered. Despite the widespread use of SDMs, standardisation and documentation of modelling protocols remain limited, which makes it hard to assess whether development steps are appropriate for end use. To address these issues, we propose a standard protocol for reporting SDMs, with an emphasis on describing how a study's objective is achieved through a series of modeling decisions. We call this the ODMAP (Overview, Data, Model, Assessment and Prediction) protocol, as its components reflect the main steps involved in building SDMs and other empirically-based biodiversity models. The ODMAP protocol serves two main purposes. First, it provides a checklist for authors, detailing key steps for model building and analyses, and thus represents a quick guide and generic workflow for modern SDMs. Second, it introduces a structured format for documenting and communicating the models, ensuring transparency and reproducibility, facilitating peer review and expert evaluation of model quality, as well as meta-analyses. We detail all elements of ODMAP, and explain how it can be used for different model objectives and applications, and how it complements efforts to store associated metadata and define modelling standards. We illustrate its utility by revisiting nine previously published case studies, and provide an interactive web-based application to facilitate its use. We plan to advance ODMAP by encouraging its further refinement and adoption by the scientific community.},
